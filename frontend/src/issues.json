However, leveldb-specific functionality should be abstracted by the `dbwrapper` and does not need to be available to the rest of the code. Having leveldb included in a widely-used header such as `dbwrapper.h` bloats the entire project's header tree.\r\n\r\nThe `dbwrapper` is a key component of the libbitcoinkernel library. Future users of this library would not want to contend with  having the leveldb headers exposed and potentially polluting their project's namespace.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, the leveldb headers are removed from the `dbwrapper` by moving leveldb-specific code to the implementation file and creating a [pimpl](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/pimpl) where leveldb member variables are indispensable. As a final step, the leveldb include flags are removed from the `BITCOIN_INCLUDES` and moved to places where the dbwrapper is compiled.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis pull request is part of the [libbitcoinkernel project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27587), and more specifically its stage 1 step 3 \"Decouple most non-consensus headers from libbitcoinkernel\".",

Especially to make sure our wallet can spend from it and doesn't allow a bigger one (no 999 of 1000 and no 1 of 1000).\r\n\r\n### Possible solution\r\n\r\nEither expand the descriptors unit test and/or one of the wallet functional tests.\r\n\r\n### Useful Skills\r\n\r\nPython and a basic understanding of [output descriptors](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/descriptors.md). Understanding (Mini)script (interpreter) is not necessary unless you actually want to understand why the limit is there.\r\n\r\n### Guidance for new contributors\r\n\r\nWant to work on this issue?\r\n\r\nFor guidance on contributing, please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening your pull request.",

This can be improved in the future. For example, the python script can exit after some time (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20752#discussion_r549248791).

    "body": "This PR furthers the P2P message serialization/deserialization abstraction introduced in #16202 and #16562, in preparation for introducing the BIP324 v2 transport (making this part of #27634). However, nothing in this PR is BIP324-specific, and it contains a number of independently useful improvements.\r\n\r\nThe overall idea is to have a single object in every `CNode` (called `m_transport`) that is responsible for converting sent messages to wire bytes, and for converting received wire bytes back to messages, while having as little as possible knowledge about this conversion process in higher-level net code. To accomplish that, there is an abstract `Transport` class with (currently) a single `V1Transport` implementation.\r\n\r\nStructurally, the above is accomplished by:\r\n* Merging the `TransportDeserializer` and `TransportSerializer` classes into a single `Transport` class, which encompasses both the sending and receiving side. For `V1Transport` these two sides are entirely separate, but this assumption doesn't hold for the BIP324 transport where e.g. the sending encryption key depends on the DH key negotiation data received from the other side. Merging the two means a future `V2Transport` can handle all this interaction without callers needing to be aware.\r\n* Removing the assumption that each message is sent using a computed header followed by (unmodified) data bytes. To achieve that, the sending side of `Transport` mirrors what the receiver side does: callers can set a message to be sent, then ask what bytes must be sent out, and then allowing them to transition to the next message.\r\n* Adding internal locks to protect the sending and receiving state of the `V1Transport` implementation. I believe these aren't strictly needed (opinions welcome) as there is no real way to use `Transport` objects in a multi-threaded fashion without some form of external synchronization (e.g. \"get next bytes to send\" isn't meaningful to call from multiple threads at the same time without mechanism to control the order they'll actually get sent). Still, I feel it's cleaner to make the object responsible for its own consistency (as we definitely do not want the entire object to be under a single external GUARDED_BY, as that'd prevent simultaneous sending and receiving).\r\n* Moving the conversion of messages to bytes on the sending side from `PushMessage` to `SocketSendData`, which is needed to deal with the fact that a transport may not immediately be able to send messages.\r\n\r\nThis PR is not a refactor, though some commits are. Among the semantic changes are:\r\n* Changing the send buffer pushback mechanism to trigger based on the memory usage of the buffer rather than the amount of bytes to be sent. This is both closer to the desired behavior, and makes the buffering independent from transport details (which is why it's included here).\r\n* When optimistic send is not applicable, the V1 message checksum calculation now runs in the net thread rather than the message handling thread. I believe that's generally an improvement, as the message handling thread is far more computationally bottlenecked already.\r\n* The checksum calculation now runs under the `CNode::cs_vSend` lock, which does mean no two checksum calculations for messages sent to the same node can run in parallel, even if running in separate threads. Despite that limitation, having the checksum for non-optimistic sends moved in the net thread is still an improvement, I believe.\r\n* Statistics for per-message-type sent bytes are now updated when the bytes are actually handed to the OS rather than in `PushMessage`. This is because the actual serialized sizes aren't known until they've gone through the transport object.\r\n\r\nA fuzz test of the entire `V1Transport` is included. More elaborate rationale for each of the changes can be found in the commit messages.",

Not having a too short case causes a fall though into the conditions of ```\"Invalid separator position\" || \"Missing separator\"```\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nSimply add a check for a minimum Bech32 string size after or during the check for the maximum size which is already implemented.\r\n\r\nCascading effects of this would be seen in DecodeDestination if https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/32c15237b656209b932c5d6d2e20736c0e3d5a34/src/key_io.cpp#L85-L86 was patched to not consider bech32 invalid then attempt to Base58Decode it becuase of the incorrect HRP for the current chain.\r\n\r\nReferenced in \r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/26290\r\n\r\nPR \r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27260\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\n\r\nYou could case this into other logic on a case by case basis in code. Example make a speical case inside DecodeDestination to display the correct error message to the user by if LocateErrors returns 'Invalid ```\"separator position\" || \"Missing separator\"``` then you check to see if the string is to short.\r\n\r\n### Additional Context\r\n\r\nAs an aside there is already a check for string length greater than 90 (MAX LEN)\r\n\r\nin src/test/bech32_tests.cpp both [\"10a06t8\",\"1qzzfhee\"] produce ```{\"Invalid separator position\", {0}}``` The former is non conformant to BIP173 due not even having enough chars to represent a BASE32 string and the second genuinely has a wrong separator position. \r\n\r\nAdding this case would make DecodeDestination more accurate for anyone who wants to to implement bech32.{cpp,h}\r\n\r\n\r\n### A comparison of this PRs error vs the current 25.99 error for Bech32 string that does not meet the minimum length requirement.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/3104223/2b975904-3a65-46b9-bee2-99c64eae59b9)\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "## Rationale\r\n\r\nCurrently, `addnode` has a couple of corner cases that allow it to either connect to the same peer more than once, hence wasting outbound connection slots, or add redundant information to `m_added_nodes`, hence making Bitcoin iterate through useless data on a regular basis.\r\n\r\n### Connecting to the same node more than once\r\n\r\nIn general, connecting to the same node more than once is something we should try to prevent. Currently, this is possible via `addnode` in two different ways:\r\n\r\n1. Calling `addnode` more than once in a short time period, using two equivalent but distinct addresses\r\n2. Calling `addnode add` using an IP, and `addnode onetry` after with an address that resolved to the same IP\r\n\r\nFor the former, the issue boils down to `CConnman::ThreadOpenAddedConnections` calling `CConnman::GetAddedNodeInfo` once, and iterating over the result to open connections (`CConman::OpenNetworkConnection`) on the same loop for all addresses.`CConnman::ConnectNode` only checks a single address, at random, when resolving from a hostname, and uses it to check whether we are already connected to it.\r\n\r\nAn example to test this would be calling:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbitcoin-cli addnode \"127.0.0.1:port\" add\r\nbitcoin-cli addnode \"localhost:port\" add\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd check how it allows us to perform both connections some times, and some times it fails.\r\n\r\nThe latter boils down to the same issue, but takes advantage of `onetry` bypassing the `CConnman::ThreadOpenAddedConnections` logic and calling `CConnman::OpenNetworkConnection` straightaway. A way to test this would be:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbitcoin-cli addnode \"127.0.0.1:port\" add\r\nbitcoin-cli addnode \"localhost:port\" onetry\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Adding the same peer with two different, yet equivalent, addresses\r\n\r\nThe current implementation of `addnode` is pretty naive when checking what data is added to `m_added_nodes`. Given the collection stores strings, the checks at `CConnman::AddNode()` basically check wether the exact provided string is already in the collection. If so, the data is rejected, otherwise, it is accepted. However, ips can be formatted in several ways that would bypass those checks. \r\n\r\nTwo examples would be `127.0.0.1` being equal to `127.1` and `[::1]` being equal to `[0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1]`. Adding any pair of these will be allowed by the rpc command, and both will be reported as connected by `getaddednodeinfo`, given they map to the same `CService`. \r\n\r\nThis is less severe than the previous issue, since even tough both nodes are reported as connected by `getaddednodeinfo`, there is only a single connection to them (as properly reported by `getpeerinfo`). However, this adds redundant data to `m_added_nodes`, which is undesirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Parametrize `CConnman::GetAddedNodeInfo`\r\nFinally, this PR also parametrizes `CConnman::GetAddedNodeInfo` so it returns either all added nodes info, or only info about the nodes we are **not** connected to. This method is used both for `rpc`, in `getaddednodeinfo`, in which we are reporting all data to the user, so the former applies, and to check what nodes we are not connected to, in `CConnman::ThreadOpenAddedConnections`, in which we are currently returning more data than needed and then actively filtering using `CService.fConnected()`\r\n",

    "body": "We currently work around a longstanding GCC issue with aligned vector instructions, by patching the behaviour we want into GCC (see discussion in #24736). Possibly in response to the GCC thread (https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=54412#c40), a new option was [introduced into the binutils assembler](https://sourceware.org/git/?p=binutils-gdb.git;a=commit;h=c8480b58e1968f209b6365af7422678f348222c2) with the 2.38 release:\r\n```\r\nx86: Add -muse-unaligned-vector-move to assembler\r\n\r\nUnaligned load/store instructions on aligned memory or register are as\r\nfast as aligned load/store instructions on modern Intel processors.  Add\r\na command-line option, -muse-unaligned-vector-move, to x86 assembler to\r\nencode encode aligned vector load/store instructions as unaligned\r\nvector load/store instructions.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's not clear how much usage this (new) option is getting, but it came up during discussion today, and could quite possibly be more sane than continuing to patch our desired behaviour into GCC (see the [patch adjustments made for GCC 12](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27897/commits/796dd5ced062c83a41bffc5dfc3f51ba4fb140e6)).\r\n\r\nSome basic comparision of masters Guix built `bitcoind.exe`, and the Guix built binaries produced using this branch would suggest that it's working as intended. i.e dissasembling the binaries, and looking for aligned instruction usage, i.e `vmovdqa*` or `vmova*`, shows that they aren't being used, in favour of unaligned variants (`vmovdqu*` & `vmovu`). However note that there is a single usage of `vmovapd` in this branch _and_ the current release binaries.\r\n\r\nThis is based on #27897, for binutils `2.38`, GCC 12 (and the newer time machine), so in terms of this change, only the last commit is relevant.",
